----------------------------------------

> Inspired by [a popular Visual Studio feature request](https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/issues/71898) on GitHub.

Fixes the issue where typing a quote character (' or ") before or after a word, causes auto-insertion of a second quote character in C#. This is a common annoyance when typing in Visual Studio that this extension attempts to fix.

## Features

* Makes quote completion less intrusive
* Adds quote completion after $ and @ characters

TODO: Add screenshots and video

## How can I help?
If you enjoy using the extension, please give it a ★★★★★ rating on the [Visual Studio Marketplace][marketplace].

Should you encounter bugs or if you have feature requests, head on over to the [GitHub repo][repo] to open an issue if one doesn't already exist.

Pull requests are also very welcome, since I can't always get around to fixing all bugs myself. This is a personal passion project, so my time is limited.
